    "- Check Constraints: Used to enforce domain integrity by specifying conditions that must be true for data to be inserted or updated in a table.\n",
    "- Triggers: Used to automatically perform actions (such as updating other tables or enforcing business rules) in response to data modification events (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Ensuring Non-Negative Amount in Allocation Table\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Allocation\n",
    "MODIFY COLUMN Amount FLOAT NOT NULL CHECK (Amount >= 0);\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Purpose: Ensures that the Amount column in the Allocation table cannot be negative.\n",

    "#### Error Handling and Data Integrity\n",
    "- Data Integrity Constraints: Investigate scenarios where data integrity constraints (e.g., foreign keys) enforce relationships between tables, considering the presence of NULL values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inserting New Portfolio with Optional Risk\n",
    "- When inserting a new portfolio into Portfolio, if the Risk field is not known initially, it could be inserted as NULL.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Portfolio (PortfolioID, TotalAmt, Risk)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 10000.0, NULL);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assigning Stocks to Portfolios\n",
    "- If a portfolio does not currently hold any stocks, its entry in PortfolioHasStock might initially contain NULL values for StockID.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO PortfolioHasStock (PortfolioID, StockID)\n",
    "VALUES (1, NULL);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Querying with Outer Joins\n",
    "- To find portfolios and their associated stocks, including those without any assigned stocks, an outer join can be used to include NULL StockID.\n",

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Understanding NULL values is crucial for database management, as they provide a mechanism to represent missing or undefined data. Mastering their behavior in SQL queries and their implications on data integrity ensures efficient and accurate database operations."
