    "\n",
    "## Real-World Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a real-world example. Meet Sarah, a new investor who has researched five companies she likes. She has $10,000 to invest and is moderately risk-tolerant.\n",

    "- **Expected Return**: 8% per annum\n",
    "- **Risk Metrics**: Standard Deviation, Beta, etc.\n",
    "- **Efficient Frontier**: Display of efficient frontier graph with statistical accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ERD and Backend Design\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this functionality, our tool's backend is designed with a robust database structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ERD Diagram](ERD2.png)  <!-- Add your ERD diagram image here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) showcases the relationships between Users, Portfolios, Stocks, and Allocations, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Legend\n",
    "Entity Nodes:\n",
    "- SESSION (SSN)\n",
    "- STOCK (S)\n",
    "- PORTFOLIO (P)\n",
    "- ALLOCATION (A): We will make an efficient frontier to determine the allocated amount to each stock.\n",
    "- HISTORY (H)\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship Nodes:\n",
    "- HAS (H1, H2, H3, H4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes (Elliptical Nodes):\n",
    "- SID (Session ID)\n",
    "- StkID (Stock ID)\n",
    "- Ticker (Stock Ticker)\n",
    "- Sector (Stock Sector)\n",
    "- CurP (Current Price)\n",
    "- Vol (Volatility)\n",
    "- ER (Expected Return)\n",
    "- PID (Portfolio ID)\n",

    "Relationships: \n",
    "- One portfolio has one session\n",
    "- One portfolio has many stocks\n",
    "- One portfolio has one allocation\n",
    "- One stock has one historical data \n",

    "## Link to Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "We've integrated several key modules to build our tool effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linked Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RDMS**: Utilizes SQL databases to store and manage data. We fetch stock data from sources like Yahoo Finance and store it in our RDMS.\n",
    "2. **Conceptual Design**: The ERD helps in visualizing and planning the backend setup, crucial for project kick-off.\n",
    "3. **Relational Data Model**: Moving forward we can begin the build or sets of data to conform to this model\n",
    "4. **Complex SQL Queries**: We can begin to connect our data and extract whats necessary by using more advanced queries\n",
    "5. **Basic Security**: Since we are gathering users names and other data, we will need to be able to secure this information in a reliable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate/Obtain Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We obtain data from external sources like Yahoo Finance, focusing on historical data such as daily prices for a set period.\n",
    "2. Using this historical data, we calculate necessary metrics such as the expected return and variance of each stock to assess risk.\n",
    "3. We relate chosen stocks to obtain relative quantities for the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Increase Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance our tool's capabilities, we can introduce additional complexities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Market Benchmarking**: Compare portfolio performance against market indices.\n",
    "2. **Diverse Assets**: Include bonds and commodities in the portfolio analysis.\n",
    "3. **Asset Constraints**: Implement maximum and minimum weights for certain assets.\n",
    "4. **Advanced Optimization**: Utilize techniques like Quadratic Programming, Linear Programming, and Heuristic Methods for more precise optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
