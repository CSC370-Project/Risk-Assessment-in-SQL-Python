    "#### Where it Relates\n",
    "\n",
    "- RDMS Data Repository:\n",
    "    - Our project successfully employs SQL queries to filter, sort, and join data from multiple tables, particularly when fetching historical stock data and allocation information, enabling efficient portfolio calculations and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic Conceptual Design:\n",
    "    - Our portfolio optimization project implicitly uses ERD concepts by defining entities such as Stocks, History, and Allocation, each with their own attributes, reflecting the basic structure of an ERD.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Relational Data Model:\n",
    "    - Our project enforces referential integrity by using foreign keys to link related tables, such as linking the History table to the Stocks table via the Ticker attribute, ensuring data consistency across related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complex SQL Queries:\n",
    "    - Our project uses aggregation queries to calculate important metrics, such as average stock prices or total portfolio value, grouping data by relevant attributes like ticker or date.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic Security:\n",
    "    - We set up different privilege levels for various user roles, such as read-only access for viewers and full access for administrators, to maintain data security and integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ACID Transactions:\n",
    "    - Our project ensures atomicity by batching related queries, such as inserting stock data and historical prices, into transactions to guarantee that all operations are completed successfully or none at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advanced Conceptual Design:\n",
    "    - Our project implicitly uses inheritance concepts by organizing different types of financial instruments (e.g., stocks, bonds, ETFs) under a common \"Asset\" entity, allowing for shared attributes and specialized characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advanced Relational Design:\n",
    "    - Our project implicitly connects conceptual and logical design by translating entity relationships (e.g., between Stocks and History) into relational database tables with appropriate foreign key constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advanced SQL Queries:\n",
    "    - Our project uses complex queries to retrieve and analyze stock data, including subqueries for calculations like average prices or portfolio performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyzing Query Algorithms:\n",
    "    - We utilize B+-tree indexes to efficiently perform lookups and range queries on disk-resident data, ensuring that our queries remain performant even with substantial data volumes."

    "#### Where We Could Improve\n",
    "\n",
    "- RDMS Data Repository:\n",
    "    - We could enhance our data storage by implementing more advanced MySQL features, such as using ENUM types for predefined categories or implementing table partitioning for improved query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic Conceptual Design:\n",
    "    - We could create an explicit ERD for our project, visually representing the entities, attributes, and relationships in our database design, which would aid in communication and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Relational Data Model:\n",
    "    - We could formally decompose our database relations into Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) by systematically analyzing and eliminating any partial or transitive dependencies to create a more efficient and reliable database design.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complex SQL Queries:\n",
    "    - We could enhance our use of aggregation by implementing more complex statistical calculations, such as moving averages or correlation coefficients, to provide deeper insights into portfolio performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic Security:\n",
    "    - We could enhance our access management by implementing more granular user roles and permissions, allowing for finer control over who can access specific parts of the database or perform certain operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ACID Transactions:\n",
    "    - We could improve our atomicity handling by implementing more complex transaction management, such as nested transactions, to handle more intricate operations and rollback scenarios effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advanced Conceptual Design:\n",
    "    - We could explicitly model inheritance relationships in our database schema, creating a more structured hierarchy for different types of financial instruments and their specific attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advanced Relational Design:\n",
    "    - We could create an explicit mapping document that shows how each entity and relationship in our ERD translates to specific tables and constraints in our relational schema, ensuring a clear connection between conceptual and logical designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advanced SQL Queries:\n",
    "    - We could review our existing complex queries, especially those with subqueries, and attempt to simplify them by converting subqueries into more efficient join operations, potentially improving query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyzing Query Algorithms:\n",
    "    - We could further analyze the I/O complexity of our B+-tree based queries, ensuring that our index structures are optimized for the specific access patterns of our application."

    "### Security Issues with Using a Command-Line Interface through an RDS Web Server\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unauthorized Access**: \n",
    "   - The command-line interface connected to an RDS web server potentially exposes the database to anyone who can connect, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lack of Fine-grained Access Control**: \n",
    "   - Without proper security measures, all users connecting through the CLI might have the same level of access, making it difficult to implement the principle of least privilege.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Potential for SQL Injection**: \n",
    "   - Direct SQL input through a CLI increases the risk of SQL injection attacks if user inputs are not properly sanitized.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Limited Audit Trail**: \n",
    "   - Basic CLI setups may not provide comprehensive logging of user actions, making it difficult to track and audit database activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Exposure of Connection Details**: \n",
    "   - Connection credentials might be exposed if not properly secured, especially in scripts or command history.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Network Security Risks**: \n",
    "   - If the RDS instance is publicly accessible, it increases the attack surface and potential for unauthorized access attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mitigation Strategies\n",
    "To mitigate these risks, consider implementing SQL security features such as GRANTS, VIEWS, and ROLES. Additionally, network-level security measures like VPCs, security groups, and potentially VPN connections should be utilized to enhance the overall security posture of your database setup.\n"

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "1. **GRANTS**:\n",
    "   - Use GRANT statements to control user access to specific tables or views.\n",
    "   - Example: \n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     GRANT SELECT ON Stocks TO 'viewer_role';\n",
    "     GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON Allocation TO 'portfolio_manager';\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - This allows you to give specific permissions to different user roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **VIEWS**:\n",
    "   - Create views to simplify complex queries and restrict access to underlying tables.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE VIEW PortfolioSummary AS\n",
    "     SELECT p.PortfolioID, s.Ticker, a.Amount, s.Price\n",
    "     FROM Portfolio p\n",
    "     JOIN Allocation a ON p.PortfolioID = a.PortfolioID\n",
    "     JOIN Stocks s ON a.Ticker = s.Ticker;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Users can query this view without needing direct access to the base tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **REVOKE**:\n",
    "   - Use REVOKE to remove previously granted permissions.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE ON Stocks FROM 'analyst_role';\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ROLES**:\n",
    "   - Create roles to group permissions and assign them to users.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE ROLE 'read_only';\n",
    "     GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'read_only';\n",
    "     GRANT 'read_only' TO 'viewer_user'@'localhost';\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Column-Level Permissions**:\n",
    "   - Grant or revoke permissions on specific columns.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     GRANT SELECT (Ticker, Price) ON Stocks TO 'market_watcher';\n",
    "     ```\n"
