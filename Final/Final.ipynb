    "    You should provide some evidence that you completed the work and met the success criteria that you set\n",

In this case, you can set more aspirational targets for how you would improve this project further if you had another couple weeks or another semester.\n",

You should also indicate how you would develop your course-level competencies further, e.g., with content from other related courses. Ideally you can describe how to connect this course with the rest of your academics and professional experience and make plans for evaluating personal growth outside of this course's structure."
