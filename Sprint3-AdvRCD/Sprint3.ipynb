    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "When the main program encounters an error or needs to perform a rollback:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Connection Errors**: The program prints an error message and returns `None` for the connection and cursor.\n",
    "* **Input Errors**: The program catches `ValueError` exceptions, prints an error message, and proceeds to close the connection.\n",
    "* **SQL Execution Errors**: The program rolls back the transaction, prints an error message, and ensures that no partial changes are committed to the database.\n",
    "* **Data Insertion Errors**: Similar to SQL execution errors, the program rolls back the transaction and prints an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that the program maintains the integrity and consistency of the database by handling errors and rollbacks appropriately.\n",
